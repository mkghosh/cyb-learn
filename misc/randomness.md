# This is the place where we will talk about random and randomness in cybersecurity

## Randomness

Randomness refers to the lack of pattern or predictability in data, making it an essential component in secure systems. In cryptography, true randomness ensures an attacker cannot predict values such as keys, tokens and nonces.

## Entropy

Entriopy represents the amount of randomness or unpredictability in a system and is often used to assess the security of cryptographic keys, tokens, or random values. Higher entropy indicates greater uncertainity, making it more difficult for attackers to predict or guess the values, which is essential for secure cryptographic operations. Low entropy can lead to weak security, increasing the risk of attacks like brute-forcing or token prediction.

## Cryptographic Keys

Cryptographic keys are secret values used in algorithms to encrypt and decrypt data, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. They are critical components in symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods and must be securely generated and manged to prevent unauthorised access. The strength of a cryptographic key depends on its length and randomness.
