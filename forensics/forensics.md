# Introduction
Performing live forensic file system analysis is often an early part of incident response and is crucial in assessing and determining potential security breaches. This process involves examining digital artefacts, system logs, users, and file structures to uncover evidence of unauthorised access, malicious activities, or data compromise.

Forensics is the application of science to investigate crimes and establish facts. With the use and spread of digital systems, such as computers and smartphones, a new branch of forensics was born to investigate related crimes: computer forensics, which later evolved into, digital forensics.
