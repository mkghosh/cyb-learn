# Malware Analysis

When analysing malware, it is important to consider the following:

- Point of Entry (PoE) i.e. Was it through spam that our e-mail filtering missed and the user opened the attachement? Let's review our spam filters and train our users better for future prevention!
- What are the indicators that malware has even been executed on a machine? Are there any files, processes, or perhaps any attempt of "un-ordinary" communication?
- How does the malware perform? Does it attempt to infect other devices? Does it encrypt files or install anything like a backdoor / Remote Access Tool (RAT)?
- Most importantly - can we ultimately prevent and/or detect further infection?

There are two categories used when analysing malware, these are:

1. Static Analysis
2. Dynamic Analysis

## Static Analysis

At its briesf, "Static Analysis" is used to gain a high-level abstraction of the sample - it can be fairly simple to decide if a piece of code is "malicious" or not with this method alone. At its core, this method is of the analysis of the sample at the state it presents itself as, whithout executing the code.

Employing the use of thechniques such as signature analysis via checksums means quick, efficient (albiet extremely brief) and safe analysis of malware.

## Dynamic Analysis

This step is a lot more involved, and is where the abstraction of the sample is largely built upon. "Dynamic Analysis" essentially involves executing the sample and observing what happens. This of course is not safe. If the sample turns out to be Ransomware - you've now lost your files. If it is capable of propagating via traversing a network, nice... You've now just infected your Local Area Network (LAN).

## MD5 checksums

MD5 checksums are useful media to know if the file is genuine or not. MD5 sums are usually provided along with the file in the original website, so we can compare the calculated MD5 sum with the provided one to know if the file has been altered or not.

## What is Packing?

Packing is one of form of obfuscation that malware Authors employ to prevent the analysis of programmes. There are both legitimate and malicious reasons as to why the author of a program will want to prevent the decompilig of their program.

For example, a legitimate reason is the protection of intellectual property! Whilst I'm one for open-source as much as the next person here - alas not every organisation has the same mindset, but let's leave that aside.

In some token, just because you write a program why should everyone have the right to copy your project? This is one of teh justifiable reasons for obfuscation - it is your at the end of the day!

However, malware authors employ obfuscation techniques such as packing - whilst for the same reasons, they do so with the intent to prevent people like us reversing it to understand its behaviours and ultimately with the aims of achieving infection.
