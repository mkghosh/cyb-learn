## Scanning

### Port Scanning

Port Scanning is the most comming and basic thing to do in the enumeration phase of the attack. Metasploit has a number of modules to scan open ports on the target system and network. You can list potential port scanning modules available using the ```search portscan``` command in the ```msfconsole```.
