## Scanning

### Port Scanning

Port Scanning is the most comming and basic thing to do in the enumeration phase of the attack. Metasploit has a number of modules to scan open ports on the target system and network. You can list potential port scanning modules available using the ```search portscan``` command in the ```msfconsole```.

Portscanning module will require you to set a few options.

![meta-port-param](../resources/metasploit/meta-port-param-set.png "setting parameters for port scanner")

* CONCURRENCY: Number of targets to be scanned simultaneously.
* PORTS: Port range to be scanned. Please note that 1-1000 here will not be the same as using Nmap with the default configuration. Nmap will scan the 1000 most used ports, while Metasploit will scan port numbers from 1 to 1000.
* RHOSTS: Target or target network to be scanned.
* THREADS: Number of threads that will be used simultaneously. More threads will result in faster scans.

We can directly perform Nmap scans from the msfconsole prompt as shown below faster:
