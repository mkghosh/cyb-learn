## Typical HTTP request

```html
GET /login HTTP/1.1 [1]
Host: localhost:3000 [2]
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:61.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/61.0 [3]
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 [4]
Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5 [5]
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate [6]
Connection: close [7]
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 [8]
```

- [1] The first part is known as the HTTP verb that tells the server what kind of action the client is requesting. THe most common types are: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
  The second part refers to the path the action is directed towards - in this case the client is telling the server to get the login page. The third part refers to the protocol - in this case it is version 1.1 of HTTP protocol.
- [2-8] lines 2 to 8 are known as HTTP headers. Header are used by both the client and server to pass extra information to each respective entity. Headers are usually in the form Name: Value

## Typical HTTP response

When the server receives this request, it will respond to the action with an HTTP response. In the case of the following request, this is the response:

```html
HTTP/1.1 200 OK[1]
X-Powered-By: Express[2]
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8[3]
Content-Length: 1493[3]
ETag: W/"5d5-ZdJhoKmkW86HklS/Wy+dOEaa80A"[4]
Date: Fri, 29 Nov 2019 00:20:52 GMT[5]
Connection: close[6]

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
```

- [1] The first part of [1] contains the version of the HTTP protocol that the server uses. The second part is known as a status/response code. Response codes are used by the server to indicate the status of a request. They are divided into the following classes:

1XX - Information Requests
2XX - Successful Requests
3XX - Redirects
4XX - Client Errors
5XX - Server Errors

- [2]-[8] are response headers used to pass information to the client. You may notice that [2] is prefaced with “X-” . This is usually the format of a custom header, so anytime you see something like that, it’s worth finding out more. After [6], depending on whether the request is successful, the server will usually pass in content of a page.

Here are some other things to note about the HTTP protocol that will be useful later on:

- HTTP is stateless: the server has no way to keep track of the order of requests the client is sending
- HTTP is unencrypted and is usually used with TLS to form HTTPS, an encrypted form of HTTP which uses certificates to verify that the website really is what is claims to be (i.e. google versus goggles)
- HTTP commonly runs on port 80 while HTTPS commonly runs on port 443 - these can be changed
- There’s a lot more that goes into making a connection from a client to the server and HTTP is only part of that

If HTTP can't keep state, how does the server keep track of what the client is doing, especially if they've logged in and are buying products?

## Cookies

The solution is cookies. Cookies are a key value pair in the form of name:value and can be used for various purposes. For now, we'll focus on the session management. Session Management refers to how the server keeps track of the actions performed by a client. Sessions are usually created with the following workflow:

- User sends username and password to the server to authenticate themselves
- Server checks if users details are correct and sets a cookie
- Every time the user performs an action, the browser sends the cookie as part of the request to the server, which then checks to cookie to ensure the user is authorised to perform a particular action.

Note: An important note to consider is that cookie values will be encoded from time to time. A browser and a server may not be able to interpret particular characters so the value placed in a cookie is encoded when it's sent and decoded under the hood (at either end).

## Day 1

In day 1 we will use a session hijacking methodology to get to login in the portal. After starting the machine we get the login page.

### The steps to solve the problems

First register a user using the the register button then login and bring up the inspect window in the browser. We can see that the cookie under storage tab. Where we have found the name of the cookie that is used to authenticate.

Let's grab the value and as we can see this is a base64 encoded value so let's decode it.

```bash
echo "cookie value" | base64 -d
```

We can see that the cookie has a fixed part in it, and it is using the username as the changed value so we can now forge a cookie with the given username and encode it to base64 then set it to he value field and voila we get the mcinventory users dashboard.

```bash
echo 'mcinventory[------]' | base64 # Replace the [] part with the fixed value that is used in the site.
```

## Day 2

### What is the path of the hidden page?

To get this answer we need to use a directory bruteforcing tools (i.e. feroxbuster, dirbuster, gobuster, or dirsearch). We will use [dirsearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch) here.

Let's install dirsearch: clone the git repository then create a virtual env using ```python3 -m venv dir-env``` and activate it. Install all the requirements from requirements.txt given in the repository then build the package and install it.

```bash
$source dir-env/bin/activate
$pip install -r requirements.txt
$python3 setup.py -v build
$python3 setup.py -v install
```

Now we can use dirsearch to search the target for any files and folder.

```bash
$dirsearch -u http://ip:port/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

And we have found answer to our first question.
